# Contributing to ELARA

This document defines the contribution workflow for the ELARA project.
This is still underprogress and subject to change. 

## Branching Strategy
- `main` is the stable branch
- All development happens on feature branches
- Direct commits to `main` are not allowed

## Naming Conventions
- Backend branches: `backend-*`
- Frontend branches: `frontend-*`
- Documentation branches: `docs-*`

## Commit Guidelines
- Commits should be small and focused
- Messages should be clear and descriptive
- Example: `Add initial chat API endpoint`

## Pull Requests
- Every change must go through a Pull Request
- PRs should describe **what** was changed and **why**
- Code must not break existing API contracts

## Code Ownership for now
- Backend: Sarah, Adyasha
- Frontend: Priyanshi

## Notes
- Avoid overlapping work without discussion
- Keep API contracts backward compatible
